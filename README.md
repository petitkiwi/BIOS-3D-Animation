# BIOS 3D Animation
Welcome to this 3D animation of the BIOS (Bubbly Inflated Organic Structure) project.  
This project was created as part of an introduction to 3D animation using Three.js to import different objects and textures and allow the user to interact with them.

*Note: I tried to add some shaders to modify the aspect f the BIOS structure, however my computer kinda does not support this amount of technology...*
